# Hospitality Analytics Dashboard with Power BI

This project involves creating a comprehensive analytics solution for the hospitality domain using Microsoft Power BI. The objective was to analyze and visualize key performance metrics an provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

## Project Workflow

## 1. Data Preparation and Transformation

Imported raw data from multiple sources, including CSV files, Excel sheets, and relational databases.

Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to standardize and structure the data for analysis.

Implemented advanced transformation techniques like unpivoting, merging datasets, and handling missing values.

## 2. Data Modeling

Created a robust data model by defining relationships between fact and dimension tables.

Established star schema and ensured optimal performance by managing table cardinality and relationship filtering directions.

Defined hierarchies for drill-down capabilities in visualizations (e.g., Date, Region, and Property Type).

## 3. DAX Queries and Measures

Developed custom DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries to enhance analytical capabilities:
Calculated columns and measures for KPIs like Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Occupancy Rate.

Created time-intelligence measures such as Year-over-Year (YoY) and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

Used advanced DAX functions like CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, and RELATED to enable granular insights.

## 4. Interactive Visualizations

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to showcase insights, including:
Occupancy trends across regions and seasons.
Revenue performance by property type and location.
Booking channel analysis to identify top-performing platforms.
Comparative performance using slicers and dynamic filters.

Implemented best practices for dashboard design, ensuring clarity, usability, and responsiveness.

## 5. Key Insights

Identified seasonal peaks in occupancy rates and revenue.

Highlighted underperforming properties and opportunities for revenue optimization.

Revealed trends in customer preferences for booking channels and property types.
